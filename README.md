# Nick Sullivan's Projects

### [Improvibe](https://improvibe.com/)

*Developer & Designer*. A hobby project. A music web application for bands to share audio recordings with their bandmates (Slack for bands is the objective). The UI uses React, Kube CSS, and HTML canvas for a custom music player.

### [Holler Hops Bar and Grill](http://www.hollerhops.com/)

*Developer & Designer*. A website for a local restaurant with some sarcastic humor to it. With the exception of the logo, I developed and designed the entire site. The primary technologies include Materialize CSS and Node.js.

*Developer & Designer*. A funny website to accompany a card game. Uses Yahoo's PureCSS and Sequelize.js.

### [Underwater Chess](http://www.underwaterchess.com/)
